This repository holds the code to Earthquake data for the past 7 days. It shows the location and magnitude of each earthquake along with a visual of all the fault lines.

It has been styled with radii that are proportionate to the magnitude of said earthquake. Intensity is also protrayed through colors - see legend for reference.

Additionally, several map backgrounds are coded, including satellite, streets and dark mode.
